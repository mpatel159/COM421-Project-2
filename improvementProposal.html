        <h1>UI Improvement Proposal</h1>
        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>The IIT Registration portal is used by students every semester.
            While it accomplishes its tasks, we believe the portal can benefit
            from some much needed improvements.
            To see if other students feel the same way, we followed the
            following protocol in creating our usability audit:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>We Created a google survey asking students about the various
                components in the registration portal. (all questions were
                likert questions)</li>
            <li>We took notes on two students as they attempted to register for
                classes</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Results From Usability Audit</h2>
        <p>
            The results of the google survey told us that most students were
            dissatisfied with the error message that comes up when something
            goes wrong.
            When we observed the two students, we also came to the same
            conclusion as they got frustrated trying to figure out why they were
            getting errors.
        </p>

        <h2>Potential Improvements</h2>

        <p>
            Several improvements can be made to the error component.
            If it was switched from a notification to an error bar, it would
            allow for cleaner styling and it would make it easier to read.
            On top of this change, we also recommend the error message gets
            reformatted. Figure 1 showcases what the current error message looks
            like.
            We recommend removing the html tags as they add too much to the
            message and can be distracting. On top of this, the
            "click here for more information" does not yield new information.
            All it does is move the error message from the notification down
            into the summary section. Figure 2 showcases a mockup of our
            suggestions, here the error message has been simplified and made
            easier to read.
            On top of this, the "click here for more information" is an actual
            URL that opens a new page in a new tab with more details about the
            specific error.
